# REACOMMERCE FRONTEND

I developed the front-end side of the e-commerce site using React, Tailwind CSS and Redux. I provided a user-friendly interface by technically implementing UI/UX designs. Using Redux state management, I effectively managed the state across the application. I provided optimal user experience on mobile devices with responsive web design. By interacting with RESTful APIs, I provided a strong connection with the backend. Using a component-based approach, I created a modular and maintainable code infrastructure. Using Tailwind CSS, I created a fast and scalable CSS architecture.
